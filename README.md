OFC Layout Mapping for Indian States

Overview
This project provides a streamlined approach to visualizing and mapping the Optical Fiber Cable (OFC) infrastructure across various states in India. By aggregating and processing data from multiple public and proprietary sources, the code helps users understand the current state of connectivity and fiber deployment in their region of interest.

Features
Aggregation from Various Sources: Integrates OFC data from publicly available databases, GIS files, government portals, and open-access telecom records.
Custom Visualization: Produces interactive maps that highlight connectivity, key routes, and underserved regions.
Easy Extensibility: Modular codebase allows users to add new data sources or states with minimal effort.
